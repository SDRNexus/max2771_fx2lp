### Case of a genuine constellation signal

When the signal from a genuine GNSS constellation is recorded with two antennas separated
by half wavelength, the direction of arrival is detected through the phase difference between
antennas. Since a genuine constellation is distributed over the celestial sphere, different
direction of arrivals lead to a wide distribution of phases on the detected signal generated
by codeless decoding of the BPSK modulated signal (GPS L1 C/A)
