Recording the signals from a genuine constellation with two antennas spatially
separated leads to varying phases for each satellite, indicative of a genuine
signal and representative of the spatial diversity of the satellite positions
on the celestial sphere. See the other spoofing example where a singls PlutoSDR
generates all GPS signals, with a single direction of arrival for all signals,
a strong indicator of spoofing.
